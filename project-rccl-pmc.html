	<h2>The challenge</h2> <p>One of the most ambitious yet impactful
	projects I took on while at Royal Caribbean involved the complete
	redesign and re-architecture of their Cruise Planner, a massive
	e-commerce platform where guests can plan and book activities before
	their cruise.</p>

	<h2>My role</h2> <p>Working with ever-changing requirements and
	tight deadlines, I was tasked to own the design of the <b>cart</b>,
	<b>checkout</b>, and <b>order management</b> features.  This
	included all end-to-end deliverables, including research,
	wireframes, visual designs, animations, and prototypes.</p><p>I also
	worked closely with other designers on the commerce team to
	establish a consistent visual language, product owners to align on
	business requirements, and a copywriter to ensure clear, concise
	communication that suits Royal Caribbean's branding. </p>

	<h2>The visuals</h2> <p>Designing the look and feel for the cart and
	checkout flows presented a unique challenge.  I had conducted so
	much research on what other successful e-commerce sites were doing,
	I literally dreamed of shopping carts and checkout flows in my
	sleep.  While the visual design of these features needed to be
	cohesive with the rest of the Cruise Planner platform, what I had
	gathered from my research was that it also needed to be a focused
	experience for the user -- clean and straight-forward. </p>

	alt="cart page">
	
	<img
	src="images/pmc-checkout.png" class="img-responsive post-image"
	alt="default checkout page">
	
	<img
	src="images/pmc-confirm.png" class="img-responsive post-image"
	alt="confirmation page">
	
	<p>On the other hand, what I had also noticed from my research is that most checkout experiences out there end on an anticlimactic note, with a stark confirmation page -- a missed opportunity, in my opinion, for the brand to showcase their personality and get the customer looking forward to their purchase.
	  For this project, I wanted to design a confirmation page that reflected Royal Caribbean's brand as well as the excitement of an upcoming cruise.</p>
	
	<h3>Responsive designs</h3>
	<p>I also needed to design for the responsive mobile version of these flows, taking into consideration the same content, but in a much smaller screen size.  Below are a few key screens:</p>
	
	</div> </div>
	
	<img

	alt="responsive mobile screens">
	
	<div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-lg-8"> <div class="blog-thumb"> 
	
	<h2>The bells and whistles</h2>
	<p>Some of the more challenging bits of this project were hashing out the flows and interactions for smaller features, such as redeeming and/or editing credit during checkout:</p>
	
	<img
	src="images/pmc-checkout-credit.gif" class="img-responsive post-image"
	alt="redeeming credit interaction">
	
	<h3>Unhappy flows</h3>
	<p>I also had to consider instances where the user might change their mind, such as removing an item from their cart:</p>
	<img
	src="images/pmc-cart-remove.gif" class="img-responsive post-image"
	alt="remove an item in cart interaction">
	
	<p>Or canceling an order they had already made:</p>
	<img
	src="images/pmc-orders-cancel.gif" class="img-responsive post-image"
	alt="cancel an order interaction">
	
	<br>
	<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
	<p>
	Overall, this was an intense but rewarding project.  There were some next steps or add-ons that I would have loved to see to make the cart, checkout, and order management flows even better:
	<ul> <li><b>User testing</b> to either validate or improve upon the order summary and price breakdowns.  Including information on taxes, fees, discounts, etc. should provide more clarity rather than confusion.</li> <li>Implementing a <b>mini cart</b> that would display while hovering over the shopping cart icon.  Business stakeholders were very resistant to my explorations on a side-panel cart.  Adding a mini cart in a future phase could be a good compromise so that users can get a quick view of their cart without breaking the flow of exploring other products on the site.</li> </ul>
	</p>
